			BlackBerry&reg; WebWorks&trade; allows web and mobile web developers to use the SDK in combination with their development tooling of choice to develop, test and package up their web applications for BlackBerry smartphones. 
			<br/><br/>
      As of BlackBerry 10 WebWorks SDK 2.0 Beta, WebWorks is built with the <a target="_blank" href="http://cordova.apache.org">Apache Cordova</a> engine at its core. Apache Cordova is a set of device APIs that allow a mobile app developer to access native device funtions from JavaScript, presenting a common interface across multiple mobile platforms. Moving WebWorks to be built on top of Apache Cordova allows our developer much greater portability of their code to other platforms.

## Project Details

BlackBerry WebWorks is a unique platform in the mobile market and is designed to take the Web as a first class citizen to create full featured applications. It is built on three main strategic principles.

1. **Advanced Standards**

    * BlackBerry 10 support is built right into Apache Cordova as a core platform. The BlackBerry WebWorks SDK packages Apache Cordova and the BlackBerry 10 implementation to provide our developers with unprecendented cross-platform compatibility features.
        * Using Apache Cordova as the core frees up our developers to focus on providing enhanced tooling and developer experience features such as our new GUI tool for project management, config.xml editing, and build/sign/deploy workflows. With web technologies being core to who we are, this GUI-tool is built as a web application to be run in your browser of choice, leveraging nodeJS in the background to interact with your host environment.
    * It truly adopts advanced web standards such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and features a powerful implementation of SVG.
    * It runs on the market-leading WebKit&reg; browser engine. _(Also available on BlackBerry handheld version 5.0)_
    * We are working with leading productivity web frameworks, including (but not limited to) jQuery&reg; and Sencha&reg;, to make sure that they function and perform as expected.
    * It's not just about standards, it's about advanced standards and technologies that promote developer skills and productivity.

2. **Powerful Integration**

    * It is not a lowest common denominator platform. It's not an isolated environment.
    * You can create full BlackBerry Super Apps with access to the entire platform through Services and JavaScript APIs.
    * It's also completely extensible; If support for that [one API that you need](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/apis/) doesn't already exist, you can add it yourself.
    * Quickly get on the road to an attractive, secured, integrated, always-on and event-driven application that can exploit what makes the BlackBerry platform so powerful.

3. **Open**

    * BlackBerry is putting its resources on the table to become contributing members of the top web open source communities including Apache Cordova, WebKit, jQuery, and Sencha. This is a beginning, and our strategy is to broadly advance the state of the art in mobile web applications.
    * We open source practically all of the work we do on our web application platform here under the Apache 2.0 license, so you can be a driving force in its future.
    * This new BlackBerry web application platform is open in every way possible.
